# BibleStudy_tool
designing of a desktop app (or prototype) for the main purpose of studying the Scripture with Scripture.
Technology being uses:
  - Java Swing (migrating to JavaFX)
  - Postgresql database
  - looking to ustilise an online API for retrieving content (verses and versions)
  - Possibility of later development for Android
Key objectives are:
  - referencing of verses to other verses (each verse can be referenced to 0 or multiple available verses)
  - user can enter verses to store (later can be further developed to use an API and load and store verses online)
  - there is also an text area for notes for each verse
  - there will also be an option for each verse to have multiple translations of itself
  - all this is be put together in an easy to use user interface. It is currently being built on Swing API for testing but will be migrating to JavaFX (currently in progress).
